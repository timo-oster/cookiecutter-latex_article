As Doe \etal~\cite{Doe1987} have shown, it is easy to find words in text
documents. This article shows that sometimes it can be very hard, if the word is
very long, or the document is very large. As \autoref{fig:figure} clearly shows,
a document can consist of many words, but each word can only occur in one
document. This severely limits the expressiveness of written text, as words that
have been used once in a document, can never be used in another document again.
This has been a source of major annoyance for authors throughout history.
